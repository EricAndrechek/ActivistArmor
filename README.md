## How to Install

If you want to use our application, please go ahead and download the .apk file in this directory and run the app! The backend might be down but you can see the aesthetics of how the app is built. Please check out our ML models and how we scrape the reddit data. We built big metadata scrapers in order to remove any data that could incriminate the poster of the reddit thread!
